## What is DevOps? {#What-is-DevOps?}

DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increase an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity. DevOps aims to improve collaboration between the Development and Operations teams. 

The main principles of DevOps include:

- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) - This allows teams to make small changes, test them, and deploy updated code frequently in an automated fashion.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) -  Configuration and management of infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. This ties application changes to infrastructure changes.

- Monitoring and Logging - Applications and infrastructure are monitored at all times. Logs provide visibility into processes. This aids faster troubleshooting.

- Communication and Collaboration - Development and operations teams must work together with shared goals and practices.

- Cloud Computing - Applications are provisioned and managed across private, public and hybrid clouds.

- Containerization - Applications are packaged in containers which provide increased flexibility and portability across environments.

- Automation - Manual tasks are reduced or eliminated for faster processes and reduced human error.

- Continuous Testing - Automated tests are run frequently to catch issues early. Test coverage is expanded over time.

- Continuous Improvement - Existing processes are constantly refined and improved through feedback loops. Small failures expose weaknesses to address proactively.

The main goals of DevOps are to increase deployment frequency, improve system stability, gain faster feedback on product development, and achieve better collaboration between teams. Adopting DevOps methodologies helps companies become more adaptable to change and meet customer needs more efficiently.

## Common DevOps Tools {#Common-DevOps-Tools}

![Common Devops Tools](/BL-1003/devops.png)

DevOps engineers need to be familiar with a variety of tools to manage the software development lifecycle. Some of the most common and important DevOps tools include:

### Docker {#Docker}

Docker is a popular containerization platform that allows applications and services to be packaged into isolated containers. Containers provide a lightweight and portable deployment mechanism for apps. Docker makes it easy to manage containers, with capabilities like image management, container spin up/tear down, networking between containers, and more. Knowledge of Docker is a must-have for DevOps engineers.

### Kubernetes {#Kubernetes}

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system. It helps automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes coordinates clusters of hosts running Docker containers, scheduling containers on the hosts and keeping them running. DevOps engineers use Kubernetes to streamline container management across dev, test, and production environments.

### Jenkins {#Jenkins}

Jenkins is an open source automation server used to build, test, and deploy applications. It is a crucial tool for implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Jenkins can automate builds, tests, infrastructure changes, and more. DevOps engineers rely on Jenkins to automate software delivery processes.

### Ansible {#Ansible}

Ansible is a popular open source configuration management and automation platform. It uses YAML playbooks to configure systems and deploy apps. Ansible allows infrastructure to be defined as code and automated. DevOps engineers use Ansible to streamline provisioning, configuration management, and application deployments. It handles orchestration of IT environments.

## Linux Fundamentals {#Linux-Fundamental}

Linux is a popular open-source operating system used for running servers, mainframes, and embedded systems across enterprises. Having a solid grasp of Linux is crucial for any DevOps role. Here are some key concepts and skills to highlight:

### Common Commands {#Common Commands}

Knowing basic Linux commands allows you to navigate through the filesystem, manipulate files, handle processes, and modify permissions. Some common commands include:

- `cd` - change directory 
- `ls` - list directory contents
- `mkdir` - make directory
- `rm` - remove file 
- `mv` - move/rename file
- `cp` - copy file
- `cat` - display file contents 
- `less` - view file contents interactively
- `ps` - display active processes
- `kill` - terminate processes
- `grep` - search for text in files

Be prepared to demonstrate using these commands to accomplish basic tasks during the interview.

### Directory Structure {#Directory-Structure}

The Linux filesystem follows a standard directory structure with folders for different types of files. Key directories include:

- `/` - the root directory
- `/home` - user home directories 
- `/etc` - system configuration files
- `/var` - variable data like logs
- `/bin` - executable binaries 
- `/usr/bin` - more binaries
- `/tmp` - temporary files

Knowing where to find important files and being able to navigate the directory structure is expected.

### Permissions {#Permissions}

Linux manages file permissions using the owner/group/all paradigm. Permissions can be manipulated with `chmod`. Some key permission types include:

- `r` - read 
- `w` - write
- `x` - execute

File permissions are displayed as `rwxrwxrwx` with each group of 3 letters representing owner, group, and all permissions respectively. Understanding how to modify permissions and troubleshoot issues is key.

Overall, focus on demonstrating fluency with core Linux skills - this forms the foundation for effectively administering systems and automation. Hands-on experience and examples can showcase your capabilities during the interview.

## Networking Basics {#Networking-Basics}

Understanding networking basics is an important foundation for any DevOps role. Some key concepts to know:

**OSI Model**

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model describes how data is transmitted in networks. It divides the functions into seven abstract layers:

- Physical Layer - responsible for transmitting raw bits over a physical medium like copper wire or fiber optic cable. 

- Data Link Layer - packages raw bits into logical frames. Also handles error checking and flow control.

- Network Layer - determines how to route packets across different networks and IP addressing. 

- Transport Layer - manages end-to-end communication between hosts. TCP operates here.

- Session Layer - establishes, maintains and synchronizes session connections between applications.

- Presentation Layer - handles data translation and encryption.

- Application Layer - user applications and network services like HTTP, FTP reside here.

Having an understanding of the OSI model helps debug connectivity issues and identify where problems are occurring.

**TCP/IP**

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the standard protocol for transmitting data over networks and the internet. Some key points:

- IP handles logical addressing and routing of packets. 

- TCP provides reliable delivery and congestion control of data packets.

- TCP/IP provides end-to-end connectivity between hosts and networks.

- Important protocols like HTTP, SSH, FTP rely on TCP/IP for transmission.

**DNS** 

The DNS (Domain Name System) translates human readable domain names to machine IP addresses. Knowledge of DNS helps troubleshoot connectivity problems.

- DNS operates on port 53 UDP/TCP

- Local DNS server caches mappings, requests upstream authoritative DNS servers on the internet for unknown mappings.

- Records like A, CNAME, MX, NS, SOA allow mapping domains to IP, mail servers, name servers etc.

- Tools like `nslookup` and `dig` help diagnose DNS issues.

Hope this provides a good overview of essential networking basics like OSI model, TCP/IP and DNS! Let me know if you would like me to expand on any part of this section.

## CI/CD Concepts {#CI/CD-Concepts}

Continuous integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. This allows teams to detect problems early.

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The main difference between continuous delivery and continuous deployment is that with continuous delivery you have the option to push changes to production whereas with continuous deployment changes are automatically pushed to production.

Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of the production pipeline is released to customers. There's no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.

The main goals of CI/CD practices are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, reduce time to market, and reduce deployment risks.

Some key concepts related to CI/CD include:

- Version control system - Allows multiple developers to work on code and merge changes into a shared repository. Git and GitHub are commonly used.

- Automated builds - Build processes that compile code into executables are set up to run automatically whenever code is pushed to the repository.

- Automated testing - Runs unit tests, integration tests etc automatically against the new build to detect bugs and issues early.

- Deployment pipeline - Automates the stages required to get code from version control into production with decreasing environments like dev, test, stage, prod.

- Infrastructure as Code - Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code to support automated deployments.

- Continuous monitoring - Monitoring app performance, logs, etc in production to detect issues.

Mastering these concepts and practices is key for a successful DevOps implementation.

## Infrastructure as Code {#Infrastructure-as-Code}

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing infrastructure through code instead of manual processes. IaC allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using configuration files rather than through a graphical user interface.

Some key benefits of IaC include:

- **Increased Speed and Agility** - With IaC, infrastructure can be provisioned in a much faster and more efficient manner through code rather than manual processes. This enables faster setup and scaling.

- **Consistency** - IaC ensures consistency across environments by using the same templates to create infrastructure. This reduces configuration drift across environments.

- **Version Control** - IaC templates can be version controlled along with application code for easy tracking of changes.

- **Increased Productivity** - Less time spent on manual configuration and infrastructure changes means more time for innovation.

- **Documentation** - IaC code serves as documentation for your infrastructure.

Some major IaC tools include:

- **Terraform** - Terraform is a popular open source tool from HashiCorp for provisioning infrastructure across major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. It uses a declarative coding style to define infrastructure resources.

- **AWS CloudFormation** - CloudFormation is Amazon Web Services' infrastructure provisioning tool. It allows you to describe and provision AWS resources in a template format through code.

For a junior DevOps role, you should have a solid understanding of IaC concepts and hands-on experience using tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to manage infrastructure. Being able to explain the benefits of IaC and demonstrate experience provisioning and managing infrastructure as code is key.

## Containerization {#Containerization}

Containerization refers to packaging application code along with its dependencies and configuration into a single unit called a container. Containers allow applications to run reliably and consistently across different environments. 

The most popular containerization technology is Docker. Docker packages applications into standardized units called containers that have everything the application needs to run - code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. This guarantees that the application will always work the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.

Some key benefits of using Docker containers include:

- **Portability** - Docker containers can run on any OS. This makes it easy to move applications between different environments.

- **Isolation** - Applications run in isolated containers that bundle all dependencies and configuration. This prevents conflicts between applications and infrastructure.  

- **Scalability** - It's easy to scale containerized applications across data centers and the cloud. Containers make it faster and easier to deploy and scale applications.

- **Efficiency** - Containers share the host OS kernel and only package the application and dependencies. This makes them lightweight and fast to spin up. Less resources are wasted.

- **Developer Productivity** - Developers can get a standardized and reproducible environment that works identically in development, testing, and production. This speeds up onboarding and deployments.

Overall, Docker containerization provides tremendous advantages in portability, consistency, efficiency and scalability. It has become the de facto standard for running applications in the cloud and deploying microservices. Using Docker allows organizations to modernize and accelerate application delivery.

## Orchestration {#Orchestration}

Orchestration tools like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Apache Mesos are essential for managing containerized applications across clusters of hosts. As applications grow in scale, orchestration helps automate container deployment, scaling, networking, and availability. 

**Kubernetes** has emerged as the leading orchestration platform due to its feature set and large community support. Kubernetes follows a master-worker architecture, where the master nodes manage the state of the cluster and schedule containers onto worker nodes. Key components of Kubernetes include:

- Pods - The smallest unit that can be scheduled on a node. Pods encapsulate one or more containers that make up an application.

- Services - Provide networking between pods using labels and selectors. Services enable loose coupling between pods.

- Ingress - Rules for external access to services running in the cluster. Useful for load balancing traffic.

- ConfigMaps & Secrets - Provide configuration info and sensitive data to pods in a decentralized manner.

- StatefulSets - Used for stateful applications like databases that need persistent storage and stable names. 

**Docker Swarm** offers native clustering capabilities in the Docker engine. Swarm uses the standard Docker API so you can leverage existing skills and tools. Key features include:

- Automatic load balancing across nodes

- Service discovery for connectivity between containers

- Scaling up or down as needed 

- Rolling updates to deploy new app versions

**The main benefits of orchestration are:**

- High availability - Reschedule containers if nodes fail

- Scale on demand - Add/remove nodes to scale out/in

- Service discovery - Connections between containers across hosts

- Batch scheduling - Optimize resource use across infrastructure

- Automated rollouts and rollbacks - Deploy app updates with no downtime

- Centralized config management - Store config data externally from containers

Orchestration is critical for running containerized apps in production. Kubernetes is the dominant choice today, but Docker Swarm is simpler to get started with. Assess your needs and environment when choosing an orchestration platform.

## Monitoring & Logging {#Monitoring-&-Logging}

Monitoring and logging are critical for DevOps engineers to maintain and troubleshoot infrastructure and applications. Here are some key points on monitoring and logging that junior DevOps engineers should be familiar with:

- Why monitoring is important: Monitoring provides visibility into systems, tracks their health and performance, and alerts when issues arise. This allows engineers to rapidly detect and diagnose problems. Monitoring is essential for maintaining reliability and uptime.

- Popular monitoring tools: DevOps engineers should be familiar with tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Datadog, New Relic, and Prometheus. These provide metrics dashboards, alerting, log analysis, and application performance monitoring. 

- Logging best practices: Logs provide insight into app and system activity and errors. Logs should be centralized, parsed/analyzed, and correlated with other data sources. Log data should be protected and archived.

- Logging tools: Popular logging tools include the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Papertrail, and Graylog. These aggregate logs from various sources, allow searching/filtering, and provide dashboards and alerts.

- Metrics to monitor: Key metrics to monitor include CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O, application response times, error rates, and more. Thresholds can trigger alerts.

- Tracing distributed apps: Distributed tracing tools like Jaeger allow tracing requests across microservices and visualizing inter-service communication. This helps pinpoint latency issues.

- Synthetic monitoring: Simulating user transactions helps test production from an end user perspective. Tools include Selenium and Puppeteer.

Overall, competence in monitoring and logging demonstrates a DevOps engineer's ability to provide observability into systems and quickly resolve issues.
