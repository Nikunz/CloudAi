## Introduction {#Introduction}

Three-tier architecture is a software design pattern that structures applications into three logical and physical computing tiers - the presentation tier, application tier, and data tier. 

This separation of concerns provides numerous benefits:

- **Scalability** - Each tier can scale independently to meet demand. For example, adding more application servers allows the app tier to handle more load without affecting the database.

- **Flexibility** - Tiers can use different technologies best suited to their functions. The app tier could use Java while the data tier uses a database like MySQL.

- **Security** - Isolating tiers restricts direct access to data from the presentation layer. Only the app tier interacts directly with the database.

- **Maintainability** - Code and resources can be managed, updated, and scaled independently per tier.

In this guide, we will build a 3-tier architecture application on AWS. We will create:

- A presentation tier using Amazon S3 and CloudFront 
- An application tier with EC2 instances and Auto Scaling Groups
- A MySQL database in RDS for the data tier
- An Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic
- Security Groups, IAM Roles, and VPC for network security

By the end, you will have hands-on experience building and deploying a fault-tolerant, scalable 3-tier architecture on AWS.

## Prerequisites {#Prerequisites}

Before starting to build a 3-tier architecture application in AWS, you'll need:

- AWS account - You'll need an AWS account with proper IAM permissions to create and configure the necessary AWS services. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for one.

- Basic AWS knowledge - A basic understanding of core AWS services like EC2, VPC, RDS, ELB is required. You don't need to be an expert, but knowing the fundamentals will help as we go through the steps.

- Familiarity with EC2, VPC, RDS, ELB - You should have some hands-on experience launching EC2 instances, configuring VPC and subnets, creating RDS databases, and setting up ELB load balancers. Going through some beginner tutorials on these services will help prepare you.

The prerequisites above will provide the foundation needed before we dive into building the 3-tier architecture. Let's move onto the next section.

## Network Infrastructure {#Network-Infrastructure}

![Network Infrastructure](/BL-1004/process.png)

To build a 3-tier architecture in AWS, the first component we need is the network infrastructure. This provides the foundation on which we can deploy our web servers, application servers, and database. 

The key steps for the network infrastructure are:

### Create a VPC {#Create-a-VPC}

- Go to the VPC dashboard in the AWS console and click "Create VPC"
- Choose a CIDR block, such as 10.0.0.0/16. This defines the IP address range for the VPC.
- Leave other settings as default and click "Create VPC"

### Create Public, Private, and Database Subnets {#Create-Public,-Private,-and-Database Subnets}

- Create a public subnet with a CIDR like 10.0.1.0/24. This is where the web servers will be placed.
- Create a private subnet with a CIDR like 10.0.2.0/24. This is for the application servers. 
- Create a database subnet with a CIDR like 10.0.3.0/24. This is for the database.

### Configure Routing Tables {#Configure-Routing-Tables}

- Create an Internet Gateway and attach it to the VPC
- Create a public route table and add a route to the Internet Gateway for 0.0.0.0/0 traffic
- Associate the public subnets with the public route table

### Setup Security Groups {#Setup-Security-Groups}

- Create security groups for the web, app, and database tiers
- Add appropriate ingress and egress rules for each group
- For example, allow port 80/443 ingress to web group

This sets up the basic network layout and security for a 3-tier architecture in VPC. We can now go ahead and deploy EC2 instances in the subnets and assign security groups.

## Web Tier {#Web-Tier}

The web tier is where the application frontend resides. It handles the incoming HTTP requests from users. To set up the web tier:

- Launch EC2 instances in the public subnet of your VPC. Use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that has a web server like Apache or Nginx pre-installed.

- Configure an Auto Scaling group for the EC2 instances. This allows the instances to scale up and down based on demand. Set the desired capacity, minimum capacity, and maximum capacity parameters based on your estimated traffic.

- In the auto scaling launch configuration, make sure to attach the instances to the public subnet so they get a public IP address. Also configure a security group to allow HTTP and HTTPS access on ports 80 and 443.

- Install and configure the web server software if needed. For example, for Nginx you may need to add the application server's IP address to the configuration file. 

- Consider utilizing Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the EC2 instances. You can set up the load balancer to use the auto scaling group as its backend.

- Configure the security group of the load balancer to allow traffic only on ports 80 and 443 from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). This restricts direct access to the EC2 instances.

The web tier provides a scalable and secure front end for users to access the application. The auto scaling group ensures that resources can scale up and down based on demand automatically.

## Application Tier {#Application-Tier}

The application tier hosts the actual application logic and backend services for your web application. This includes components like:

- Application servers (Tomcat, Node.js, etc) 
- Application code and binaries
- Caching services like Redis or Memcached

To setup the application tier in our 3-tier architecture:

- Launch EC2 instances in the private subnet created earlier. Use a base image like Amazon Linux 2 that has Tomcat or NodeJS pre-installed.

- Configure auto scaling group with min and max number of instances. Set scaling policies based on CPU utilization. This will allow the application tier to scale out during demand spikes.

- Deploy the application code and binaries on the instances. Set up load balancing and health checks. 

- Ensure the security groups allow access only from the web tier on ports like 8080 for Tomcat and 3000 for NodeJS apps. Block all other access.

- Install and configure your choice of caching service like Redis or Memcached for performance. Run it on the same instances or dedicated cache instances. 

- Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alarms for key metrics like request count, latency, CPU usage etc.

This completes the application tier setup with scalability, security and high availability built-in. The auto scaling group manages capacity while load balancers distribute traffic across instances. The tier is isolated in the private subnet with only necessary inbound ports open.

## Database Tier {#Database-Tier}

The database tier will contain the RDS MySQL instance that will store the application's data. 

To create the RDS MySQL instance:

- In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the RDS service.
- Click "Create database" to launch the RDS setup wizard.
- For engine type, select "MySQL" and pick the latest minor version available.
- In the Templates section, choose "Free tier" to create a small db.t2.micro instance.
- Under Settings, name the DB instance identifier and set a Master Username and Master Password.
- For DB instance size, leave at default of 20GB.
- Choose the VPC created earlier and select the database subnet group.  
- Enable storage encryption.
- Once created, the endpoint for the RDS instance will be available.

To secure the database:

- Create a new security group just for RDS, allowing TCP 3306 from the app subnet.
- Assign this security group to the RDS instance.
- Restrict the incoming source IP to only allow the app servers access.

The RDS MySQL instance is now created in the database subnet and secured to only allow the application servers to connect. The endpoint can be used by the app servers to access the database.

## Load Balancing {#Load-Balancing}

Load balancing is a critical component of creating a highly available and scalable 3-tier architecture in AWS. It helps distribute traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances in the web tier. 

To implement load balancing:

- Create an internet-facing Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) in the public subnets of your VPC. Use the ELB creation wizard in the AWS console to select the public subnets and configure your health checks.

- Configure health checks for the ELB to periodically check the health status of the EC2 instances behind it. Set health check parameters like protocol, port, path, and response timeout.

- Register the EC2 instances in your web tier with the ELB. The ELB will now start distributing incoming traffic to the healthy registered instances.

- The ELB has its own DNS name. Route your application's domain name to this ELB DNS via a CNAME record.

This allows the ELB to distribute load across multiple web servers. Even if some instances fail health checks, the ELB will automatically stop sending traffic to them until they are healthy again. The ELB provides high availability and fault tolerance for your web tier.

## Security {#Security}

Securing the infrastructure and data is critical in any cloud deployment. Here are some key security recommendations for a 3-tier architecture in AWS:

### Limit Internet Access {#Limit-Internet-Access}

- Only the web tier subnets should allow direct internet access. Application tier and database subnets should not be exposed to the internet.

- Utilize security groups to restrict access to the application and database tiers to only allow traffic from the web tier subnet.

### Enable VPC Flow Logs {#Enable-VPC-Flow-Logs}

- Turn on VPC Flow Logs for your VPC to capture information about IP traffic going into and out of your VPC subnets.

- VPC Flow Logs sent to CloudWatch Logs can be used to monitor network traffic for anomalies and suspicious activity.

### Setup VPN for Admin Access {#Setup-VPN-for-Admin-Access}

- Don't allow direct SSH access to any instances from the internet.

- Set up a Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Client VPN for administrator access to manage the infrastructure securely. 

- The VPN allows access to private subnets and instances without exposing them directly to the internet.

### Other Security Tips {#Other-Security-Tips}

- Use IAM roles and security groups instead of storing credentials on EC2 instances.

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use EBS encryption and SSL/TLS.

- Enable AWS security services like AWS WAF on the web tier. 

- Regularly patch and update software on all tiers to latest secure versions.

- Rotate credentials periodically.

- Configure AWS Config to monitor for security configuration changes.

## Monitoring {#Monitoring}

Monitoring is critical for maintaining high availability and performance of your 3-tier architecture application in AWS. Here are some key monitoring capabilities to implement:

### Enable CloudWatch Metrics {#Enable-CloudWatch-Metrics}

- Enable detailed monitoring for EC2 instances to get metrics on CPU, network, disk usage etc. 
- Enable monitoring for ELB to track request counts, latency, healthy host count etc.
- Enable Enhanced Monitoring for RDS to get over 20 metrics on database load, disk usage, memory etc.

### Set Up Alarms {#Set-Up-Alarms}

- Create CloudWatch alarms to trigger notifications on high CPU, increased errors, or crossed thresholds.
- Set alarms on ELB latency and request counts for load changes.
- Have RDS alarms for free storage space, CPU utilization spikes etc.

### Log EC2, ELB, RDS to CloudWatch Logs {#Log-EC2,-ELB,-RDS-to-CloudWatch Logs}

- Install and configure the CloudWatch agent on EC2 instances to collect and push logs.
- Enable access logging on ELB and push logs automatically to CloudWatch.
- Turn on general and slow query logging for RDS and publish to CloudWatch Logs.

This enables real-time visibility and alerts to monitor performance and availability of the application across all tiers. Adjust resources or troubleshoot issues proactively based on the monitoring data.

## Conclusion {#Conclusion}

Building a 3-tier architecture application in AWS provides several benefits over a traditional on-premises architecture. By separating the web, application, and database tiers into separate layers, we gain improved security, flexibility, and scalability. 

In this blog post, we walked through the key steps for deploying a sample 3-tier application in AWS:

- Setting up the VPC and networking components like subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and security groups
- Creating EC2 instances for the web and app tiers, installing software, and configuring security 
- Launching an RDS database instance for the data tier
- Implementing load balancing with an Application Load Balancer
- Automating scaling rules with Auto Scaling groups
- Enabling monitoring through CloudWatch

There are additional capabilities we can leverage to enhance this 3-tier architecture further:

- Automate deployments through AWS CodePipeline and CodeDeploy for continuous integration and delivery
- Scale the application tier horizontally to handle more traffic by simply increasing the Auto Scaling group size
- Enable multi-AZ redundancy for the database to improve availability 
- Set up security tools like AWS WAF to protect against cyber attacks

By leveraging AWS's managed services and global infrastructure, we can deploy robust and secure 3-tier applications faster, with less maintenance overhead. The separation of concerns provided by the 3-tier model makes it easy to independently scale, monitor, and update each component as needed.
